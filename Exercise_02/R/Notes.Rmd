First, import libraries
```{r echo=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(knitr)
```

Second, import the data file
```{r}
f <- "../Data/data-wrangling.csv"
```

Third, generate the plots
```{r}
d <- read_csv(f, col_names = TRUE)
bm <- d$Body_mass_female_mean
bs <- d$Brain_Size_Species_Mean
plot(bm, bs)
plot(log(bm), log(bs))
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
